# form-ular

A web client side app only for filling forms.
It allows to
* create PDF with background form
* create PDF without background form
* see preview of the form

The application is not using server side, so you don't need to care 
about private data filled in form. Everything stays just in the browser 
and nothing is sent anywhere.
